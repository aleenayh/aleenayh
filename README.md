## Meet Aleena 
I build web apps and games. Primarily React/Typescript/Node but always eager to try new things. Working remote since before it was cool. Startup native. Consumer of horror media of all varieties and a board game/tabletop roleplay game geek.

DUCKS AMOK, a cardplay game with light deck-building aspects written in Phaser. I was on a team of three building the initial game (competitive team v team) and solo engineer to implement the collaborative game mode (team v environment).

POLIS, a civilization builder written in Pixi. I refactored the game and redesigned UX to fit on iPads/tablets and avoid information overload.
